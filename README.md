# alignment-experiment

IIRC (I'm writing this six years after I wrote the code), this is some code I used while I was at university in November 2016 to generate some fake results for an experiment. This was part of some coursework where we had to come up with an idea for an experiment and then write a scientific paper on the results of the experiment, using fake results since there wasn't time within the course to actually run the experiment. I did end up running the experiment for real later, though, as my dissertation project.

In the interest of giving some more context I've dug up the paper that used these results from my computer. This is the file 'Writeup-FINAL.pdf'.
